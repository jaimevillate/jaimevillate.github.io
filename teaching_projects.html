<dt><b>MAFIQUI</b></dt>
<dd>
2004 &ndash; 2005. A new course was introduced in the Engineering
School in 2004, called <b>FEUP Project</b>, to be attended by all
freshman students during their first month at the school. As part of
that course, students were required to take quizzes to assess their
knowledge in Math, Physics and Chemistry (MAFIQUI: <i>MAtemática,
FÍsica e QUÍmica</i>); the results of the first quiz was used to place
the students in different level courses that run for a few weeks,
followed by a second quiz. The aim was to prepare the students for
their programs. I was in charge of preparing the logistics of the
quizzes and coordinate the work of the Professors writing the quiz
questions and the work of the teaching assistants conducting the
recitation sessions. In the first year (September of 2004), there were
170 students enrolled and in the second year (September of 2005) all
850 freshman students were enrolled. The course was suspended after
that second year. I developed a system to prepare written multiple
choice quizzes, whose answers were then transferred to the Moodle
server by the teaching assistants, allowing students to see their
graded quizzes on-line. I have been using that same system in the
courses I teach since then.

2006 &ndash; 2008. A project approved by the dean of the School to
support the creation of virtual and remote laboratories for
teaching. The project was led by a group of professors from the
departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, Civil Engineering and Physics Engineering, supported by a
group of undergraduate students and technical staff.

<dt><b>Medição remota de micro deslocamentos</b></dt>
<dd>
Grant number: UP/CGD/13<br>
Funded by: University of Porto/ Caixa Geral de Depósitos
(Undergraduate Research Program)<br>
Period: 9/2005 &ndash; 8/2006<br>
Amount awarded: &euro;5 000<br>
Principal investigator: Teresa Restivo (FEUP)<br>
A collaboration was established within this project among
undergraduate students majoring in Mechanical Engineering and in
Informatics and Computing Engineering to make a Michelson
Interferometer, at the Physics Department, accessible via Web. The
Mechanical Engineering students undertook the structure to control the
interferometer remotely and the Web interface. The Informatics
students created a <a href="http://fisica.fe.up.pt/michelson/"
target="_blank">virtual version of the interferometer</a>, which can
be used to conduct virtual experiments on interferometry
