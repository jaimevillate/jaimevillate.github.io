<h2 id="title">Preface</h2>
<p>
The intended audience for this book are first-year college
students majoring in science or engineering. It is expected
from the student to have some basic knowledge of Linear
Algebra and Calculus. The development of personal computers
has expanded the type of problems that can be solved by a
student in an introductory Physics course.  Computational and
simulation programs allow the student to understand the
concepts involved in a physics problem even before he learns
the analytic methods to solve it. The computational methods
introduced to solve mechanics problems have been extended into
other areas outside of physics, giving rise to the general
theory of dynamical systems.
</p>
<p>
This book aims at giving the reader some basic knowledge of
mechanics and the computational techniques used to solve
dynamical systems. The Computer Algebra System (CAS)
<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net">Maxima</a> is used to
introduce those computational techniques.  The main theme of
the book is mechanics, including some contemporary subjects
such as nonlinear systems and chaos. The approach used is that
of Classical Mechanics, in which time and space are assumed to
be absolute and independent from the observers.
</p>
<p>
This book was originally written in Portuguese, as a textbook for
the course Physics 1 (EIC0010) from the first-year curriculum of the
"Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering" program (MIEIC) at the
<a href="http://www.fe.up.pt">Faculty of Engineering of the
University of Porto</a> and it is the first volume in a series of
two. The second volume is
<a href="http://def.fe.up.pt/electricity/">&quot;Electricity, Magnetism and Circuits&quot;</a>
(Villate, 2014). This book and its additional material are updated
frequently and it can be found at the site
<a href="http://def.fe.up.pt/dynamics">Dinamics and Dynamical
Systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
The course for which this textbook was written
consists of 12 weeks of classes with 2 one-hour lectures and a
two-hour practical session every week. The practical sessions
are held in a room with laptop computers that the students can
use to access the course and other websites and to run
Maxima.
</p>
<p>
The first six chapters follow the program that is
traditionally taught in an introductory mechanics course,
without including many-body systems or fluid
mechanics. Chapter 7 is an introduction to dynamical
systems. Chapter 8 is about lagrangian mechanics and chapters
9, 10 11 and 12 are about dynamical systems.
</p>
<p>
I thank Professor João Rui Guedes de Carvalho who made a careful
review of the Portuguese version and with whom I had some useful
discussions about mechanics and teaching methods. I would also
like to acknowledge the valuable help of my students, whose enthusiasm
and thirst for knowledge have been my inspiration to
write this book. There have been many students throughout the
years who have pointed out typos and confusing parts, thus helping me
to improve the text. I also thank the instructors who taught some
of the practical lectures of the course during the years when I wrote
the first versions of the book, Maria Helena Braga, Francisco
Salzedas and Helder Silva. Finally, I thank my graduate student
João Carvalho who not only assisted me with the practical sessions, but
also shared with me his knowledge of the Physics of Sports from his
experience as an athlete.
