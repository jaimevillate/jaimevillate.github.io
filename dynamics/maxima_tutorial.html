<h2>A.1. Introduction</h2>
<p><i class="notranslate">Maxima</i> is a free software package.
It can be freely downloaded for various different systems and
there is extensive documentation that can also be freely
copied. Maxima's website is at
<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net">http://maxima.sourceforge.net</a></p>
<p><i class="notranslate">Maxima</i> is one of the oldest
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). It was created by MIT's MAC
group in the 1960s and it was initially
called <i class="notranslate">Macsyma</i>
(<i class="notranslate">project MAC's SYmbolic
MAnipulator</i>). <i class="notranslate">Macsyma</i> was
originally developed for the DEC-PDP-10 large-scale computers
that were used in various academic institutions at that
time.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, its code was ported to several new platforms
and one of those derived versions was
called <i class="notranslate">Maxima</i>.  In 1982 the MIT
decided to sell <i class="notranslate">Macsyma</i> as
proprietary software and simultaneously Professor William
Schelter of the University of Texas continued to develop the
<i class="notranslate">Maxima</i> version. In the late 1980s
other proprietary CAS systems similar to
<i class="notranslate">Macsyma</i> appeared, such as
<i class="notranslate">Maple</i> and
<i class="notranslate">Mathematica</i>. In 1998, Professor
Schelter obtained authorization from the DOE (Department of
Energy), which held the copyright for the original version
of <i>Macsyma</i>, to distribute the source code
of <i class="notranslate">Maxima</i> as free software.  When
Professor Schelter passed away in 2001, a group of volunteers
was formed to continue to develop and
distribute <i class="notranslate">Maxima</i> as free
software.</p>
<p>In the case of CAS software, the advantages of free software
are very important. When a method fails or gives very
complicated answers it is quite useful to have access to the
details of the underlying implementation of the methods
used. On the other hand, as one's research and teaching
becomes dependent on the results of a CAS, it is desirable to
have good documentation of the methods involved and its
implementation and to be assured that there are no legal
barriers forbidding the examination and modification of that
code.</p>

<h2>A.2. Xmaxima</h2>
<p>There are several different interfaces to work with
Maxima. It can be run from a command shell, or from one of the
graphical interfaces as <i>wxMaxima</i>, <i>imaxima</i>
or <i>Xmaxima</i>. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-A.1">A.1</a>
shows the main window of Xmaxima, which is a graphical
interface originally developed by Professor William
Schelter.</p>
<figure class="center" id="fig-A.1">
<img class="img-15" src="../dinamica/img/xmaxima.png"
     alt="xmaxima" width="978" height="732">
<figcaption>
<b>Figure A.1:</b> <i>Xmaxima</i> graphical interface.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Xmaxima establishes a connection with the Maxima program
(using a socket), sends the commands that the user types to
Maxima and shows the results it returns.</p>
<p>Xmaxima usually opens two windows
(Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-A.1">A.1</a>). One of them, called
the <b>browser</b>, shows a tutorial and allows the user to
read the manual or other Web pages. The second window is
the <b>console</b>, where Maxima commands should be written
and their output will appear.</p>
<p>In the &quot;<span class="notranslate">Edit</span>&quot; menu
there are options to navigate the list of previous commands
(&quot;<span class="notranslate">previous input</span>&quot;)
or to copy and paste text; some options in the menus can also
be accessed with the shortcut keys shown next to them.</p>
<p>Different colors are used to distinguish commands that have
already been processed (in blue) from the command that is
being written and has not yet been sent to Maxima (in green);
the results are shown in black (see
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-A.1">A.1</a>). When changing a
command already executed or when starting a new command, care
must be taken that what is being written appears in green or
blue, to ensure that it will be sent to Maxima. Sometimes it
may be necessary to use the options
&quot;<span class="notranslate">Interrupt</span>&quot; or
&quot;<span class="notranslate">Input prompt</span>&quot;, in
the &quot;<span class="notranslate">File</span>&quot; menu to
recover the state in which Xmaxima is accepting commands.</p>
<p>It is also possible to move the prompt symbol to some older
entry in the screen (in blue), change it, and press enter to
repeat the same command with the modifications.</p>

<section id="sec-A.3">
<h2>A.3. Data input and output</h2>
<p>When a Maxima  session starts, the tag
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i1)</span> will appear, which
means <i class="notranslate">input</i> 1. A valid command
should be written next to that tag, ended with a semi-colon
and when the enter key is pressed, that input will be parsed,
simplified, linked to an internal variable
<span class="maxm notranslate">%i1</span> and its result
will be shown following a tag <span class="verb
                                           notranslate">(%o1)</span>, that means
<i class="notranslate">output</i> 1. That result will also be
linked to an internal variable <span class="maxv
                                            notranslate">%o1</span>. Another tag <span class="maxm
                                                                                              notranslate">(%i2)</span> will appear next, to mark the place
where a second command should be written and so on. The most
basic usage of Maxima is as a calculator, as in the following
examples.</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i1)</span> <span class="maxn">2.5</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxn">3.1</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o1) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;7.75<br>
<span class="maxm">(%i2)</span> <span class="maxn">5.2</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxf">log</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o2) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5.2 log 2
</div>
<p>The result <span class="verb notranslate">(%o2)</span> shows
two important aspects of Maxima. First, the natural logarithm
of 2 was not computed, because its result is an irrational
number which cannot be represented exactly with a finite
number of numerical digits. The second important aspect is
that the symbol <span class="verb notranslate">*</span> which
is always required when a product is entered and the
parenthesis, which have to be used to specify the argument of
a function, were not included in the output. That happened
because, by default, the output is shown in a mode
called <span class="maxk notranslate">display2d</span>, in
which the output tries to resemble the way mathematical
expressions are usually shown in books. The expression
&quot;<span class="verb notranslate">5.2 log 2</span>&quot;
most probably will be interpreted correctly by a reader, as
the product of 5.2 times the logarithm of 2; however, if that
same ambiguous expression was given as input to Maxima it
would trigger an error, because Maxima syntax requires an
operator between 5.2 and the logarithm function, and the
argument of the logarithm must be inside parenthesis. In spite
of the form of the output, variable <span class="maxv
                                                 notranslate">%o2</span> has been linked to an expression with
correct syntax, so it can be reused in later Maxima commands
without syntax errors.</p>
<p>To look up the documentation of a function or special
variable in the manual, for instance the function
<span id="log" class="index maxf notranslate">log</span> that
was just used, the <span id="describe" class="index maxf
                                              notranslate">describe</span> function is used, which can be
abbreviated with a question mark followed by space and the
name of the function:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i3)</span> <span class="maxm">?</span><span class="maxf"> log</span><br>
<br>
&ndash; Function: log (&lt;x&gt;)<br>
<br>
Represents the natural (base e) logarithm of &lt;x&gt;.<br>
<br>
Maxima does not have a built-in function for the base 10 logarithm
or other bases.  'log10(x) := log(x) / log(10)' is a useful
definition.<br>
&hellip;
</div>
</section>
<section id="sec-A.4">
<h2>A.4. Numbers</h2>
<p>Maxima accepts real and complex numbers. Real numbers in
Maxima can be integers, rationals, such as 3/5, or
floating-point numbers, for instance, 2.56 and 25.6e-1, which
is a short notation for
25.6&times;10<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Irrational numbers, such
as <span class="maxf
                notranslate">sqrt</span><span class="maxd">
(</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxd">)</span>
(square root of 2) or <span class="maxf
                                   notranslate">log</span>
<span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxd">)</span>

(natural logarithm of 2) are left in that form, without being
approximated by floating-point numbers, and later
calculations, such as <span class="verb
                                   notranslate">sqrt(2)^2</span> or <span class="verb
                                                                                 notranslate">exp(log(2))</span> will lead to the exact result
2.</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers are &quot;contagious&quot;; namely,
the operations in which they enter will be carried out in that
format. For example, if instead of writing
<span class="maxf notranslate">log</span><span class="maxd">
(</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxd">)</span>
one would write
<span class="maxf notranslate">log</span><span class="maxd">
(</span><span class="maxn">2.0</span><span class="maxd">)</span>,
the logarithm would be computed approximately in
floating-point.  Another way to force an expression to be
computed as a floating-point number consists on using the
function
<span id="float" class="index maxf notranslate">float</span>.
For example, since the result
<span class="verb notranslate">(%o2)</span> obtained above
was linked to the variable <span class="maxm">%o2</span>,
to get a floating-point approximation of that result one
would write:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i4)</span> <span class="maxf">float</span><span class="maxd"> (</span><span class="maxm">%o2</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o4) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3.604365338911716
</div>
<p>The function <span class="maxf notranslate">float</span>
computed the product 5.2&thinsp;log(2) approximately, using 16
significant digits in floating-point format. The
floating-point format used in Maxima stores each number in 64
binary bits, which leads to between 15 and 17 significant
digits when expressed in decimal base. That format is known
as <i class="notranslate">double precision</i>.</p>
<p>A frequent source of confusion arises from the fact that
those numbers are being represented internally in binary base
and not in decimal base; thus, certain numbers that can be
represented in decimal with a few digits, for instance 0.1,
would need an infinite number of binary digits to be
represented accurately in binary base. It is the same thing
that happens with the fraction 1/3 in decimal base, which in
floating-point form has an infinite number of digits:
0.333&hellip; (in the base 3 system that fraction can be
easily represented). The fractions that lead to an infinite
number of digits are not the same in the decimal and binary
base systems. Consider the following results, which are
perfectly correct and would appear in any system that uses
binary digits and double-precision format, but might look
puzzling to someone used to work with the decimal system:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i5)</span> <span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxn">0.1</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o5) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;0.2<br>
<span class="maxm">(%i6)</span> <span class="maxn">6</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxn">0.1</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o6) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;0.6000000000000001
</div>
<p>The explanation for this last result is that the number 0.1
cannot be written exactly using 64 binary bits. Thus,
multiplying 0.1 by 2 does not give exactly 0.2, but the
decimal number with 16 significant digits which is closer to
the result obtained is 0.2000000000000000, giving the
impression that the result of the product is exactly that,
when it is not. In the case of 6*0.1, using double precision
format, the closest number with 16 decimal significant digits
is 0.6000000000000001. Some computing systems ignore the last
digits in the results obtained from double-precision
calculations, showing the result as 0.6, but whenever binary
double-precision is used, the result of 6*0.1 will never be
exactly 0.6.</p>
<p>If the number 1/3 had to be represented in decimal system,
using only 3 significant digits, the most approximate
representation of the number would be 333/10<sup>3</sup>,
namely, 0.333. In binary system with double precision 52
significant binary digits are used, which means that the
numerator has to be less than 2<sup>52</sup> and the
denominator must be a number of the form <svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' width='1.2252709em' height='0.9665274em' viewBox='-0.6 -9.065274 12.252709 9.665274' class='inline' style='vertical-align:-0.06em'>

. Maxima's
function <span class="maxf notranslate">rationalize</span>
shows the approximate representation being used for a number,
in the form of a fraction. For instance,</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i7)</span> <span class="maxf">rationalize</span><span class="maxd"> (</span><span class="maxn">0.1</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

<br>
</div>
<p>the numerator is less than 2<sup>52</sup> (and bigger than
2<sup>51</sup>), while the denominator is exactly equal to
2<sup>55</sup>. In order for that fraction to represent
exactly 0.1, the denominator should be ten times bigger than
the numerator, namely, it should end in 70 rather than 68, but
the power of 2 closer to that number had to be used.</p>
<p>To avoid the numerical errors inherent to the floating-point
representation, fractions can be used; for example, 1/10
instead of 0.1. There is also another Maxima specific format
which accepts any arbitrary number of significant digits to
represent floating-point numbers. That format is
called <span id="big&nbsp;float" class="index
                                        notranslate"><b>big float</b></span> and it is used by writing
&quot;b&quot;, instead of
&quot;<span class="notranslate">e</span>&quot; for the
exponents; for example, 2.56&times;10<sup>20</sup>, written as
2.56e20 would be represented internally in double-precision
format, with 16 significant digits and any calculations made
with it would result in other double-precision numbers; but if
the same number is written as 2.56b20, it will be represented
internally in <i class="notranslate">big-float</i> format and
when it makes part of numerical calculations, the result will
be another number in the same format, which can have many
significant digits up to a maximum number determined by the
value of the internal variable <span class="maxv
                                            notranslate">fpprec</span>
(<i class="notranslate">floating-point precision</i>).</p>
<p>The function
<span id="bfloat" class="index maxf notranslate">bfloat</span>
converts a number into <i class="notranslate">big-float</i>
format and the default value
of <span class="maxv">fpprec</span> is 16. For example, in
order to get a numerical approximation for the
result <span class="verb notranslate">(%o2)</span>, with 60
significant digits, the following commands are used:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i8)</span> <span class="maxv">fpprec</span><span class="maxm">:</span><span class="maxn"> 60</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o8) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;60<br>
<span class="maxm">(%i9)</span> <span class="maxf">bfloat</span><span class="maxd"> (</span><span class="maxm">%o2</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o9) 3.60436533891171573209728052144843624984298344312084369367127b0
</div>
<p>The letter b, followed by zero, at the end of the result
<span class="verb notranslate">(%o9)</span> means that the
number is in the <i class="notranslate">big-float</i> format
and it should be multiplied by a factor of
10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>In the rest of this appendix and in all the chapters in this
book, all floating-point numerical results will be
automatically rounded to only 4 significant digits. That is
achieved by changing the value of the system
variable <span id="fpprintprec" class="index
                                       maxf">fpprintprec</span> from its default value of 0 to 4:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i10)</span> <span class="maxv">fpprintprec</span><span class="maxm">:</span><span class="maxn"> 4</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o10) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4
</div>
<p>internally, all floating-point numbers will continue to have
16 significant digits and <i class="notranslate">big-float</i>
numbers will have the number of significant digits set by
<span class="maxv">fpprec</span>; however, whenever a number
has to be printed in the screen, it will be rounded to 4
significant digits. If at any moment one wants to see all the
significant digits stored internally, it will be necessary to
set <span class="maxv">fpprintprec</span> back to its default
value of 0.</p>

<p>variables <span class="maxv">a</span>, <span class="maxv">b</span>,
<span class="maxv">c</span>
and <span class="maxv">Root1</span> were linked to the
numerical values 2, &minus;2, &minus;4 and 2, while
variable <span class="maxv">d</span> was linked to an
expression.</p>
<p>Notice that input <span class="maxm
                                  notranslate">(%i11)</span> was ended with a dollar
sign <span class="maxm notranslate">$</span>, rather
than a semi-colon. That will make the command to be executed
without showing its result on the screen. In any case,
variable
<span class="verb">%o11</span> became linked to the result of input
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i11)</span> and can be referred to
later, even though its value was not shown. Input
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i12)</span> shows how to link
several variables with a single command. When the name of a
variable is written, as in input
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i13)</span>, the output will
be the value linked to that variable or the name of the
variable itself if it has not been linked to any value. In the
expression given to be linked
to <span class="maxv">Root1</span>,
variables <span class="maxv notranslate">a</span>,
<span class="maxv">b</span> and <span class="maxv">c</span>
were replaced by the values linked to them, and the result was
then simplified and linked to the variable, while
variable <span class="maxv">d</span> was linked to an
expression that depends on <span class="maxv">z</span>,
because that variable was not linked to any value.</p>
<p>In order to remove the value linked to a variable, the function
<span id="remvalue" class="index maxf
                           notranslate">remvalue</span> can be used; in the next example
the value linked to
<span class="maxv">a</span> is removed and an expression that
depends on <span class="maxv notranslate">a</span> is then
linked to <span class="maxv notranslate">Root1</span>:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">

<p>To remove all values linked to variables, the command
<span class="maxf notranslate">remvalue</span><span class="maxd">
(</span><span class="maxk notranslate">all</span>
<span class="maxd">)</span> is used. Notice that a variable
can be linked to a numerical value, to an algebraic expression
or to any other Maxima object.</p>
<p>To substitute a variable in an expression by a given value,
the command <span id="subst" class="index maxf">subst</span>
is used; for instance, to get the expression linked to
<span class="maxv notranslate">Root1</span> in the case when
<span class="maxv notranslate">a</span> equals 1 and to
approximate the result to a floating-point number, the
following commands are used:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">

<p>these two last commands did not modify the expression linked to
<span class="maxv notranslate">Root1</span>, which remains
unchanged.</p>
<p>Maxima sets up several internal variables, with names
starting by <span class="verb notranslate">%</span>. Some
examples are the variables <span class="maxm
                                        notranslate">%i2</span> and
<span class="maxm notranslate">%o2</span>, linked to an input
command and its result. The symbol <span class="maxm">%</span>
by itself represents the last result obtained; for instance,
in input <span class="maxm notranslate">%i19</span> it would
have been enough to write down <span class="maxm">%</span>
instead of <span class="maxm notranslate">%o18</span>.</p>
<p>It is safer not to use variable names that are already being
used by Maxima, even though it is possible to use the same
name for a variable, a function and objects of different
kinds.</p>
<p>A variable can also be linked to a mathematical equation; for
example:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i20)</span> <span class="maxv">secondlaw</span><span class="maxm">:</span><span class="maxv"> F</span><span class="maxo"> =</span><span class="maxv"> m</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxv">a</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

<p>Maxima simplifies most of the input commands before executing
them. In this last example, as the result of that
simplification the variables in the product <span class="maxv
                                                         notranslate">m</span>
<span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxv">a</span> were reordered
alphabetically. If any of the 3 variables in the equation,
<span class="maxv notranslate">F</span>,
<span class="maxv notranslate">m</span> and <span class="maxv
                                                         notranslate">a</span> were linked to a value, that value would
have been replaced, and variable <span class="maxv
                                              notranslate">secondlaw</span> would be linked to the equation
obtained after that replacement and simplification is done.
In this case, none of the variables were linked to any values;
if later on one of the variables in the equation is linked to
value, the equation linked to <span class="maxv
                                           notranslate">secondlaw</span> remains the same, as shown by
the following commands:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">

<h2>A.6. Lists</h2>
<p>A variable can also be linked to a list of values, which are
placed inside square brackets and separated by commas. For
instance, the following command links
variable <span class="maxv notranslate">squares</span> to a
list with the squares of the first 5 positive integer
numbers:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i25)</span> <span class="maxv">squares</span><span class="maxm">:</span><span class="maxd"> [</span><span class="maxn">1</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 4</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 9</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 16</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 25</span><span class="maxd">]</span><span class="maxm">$</span>
</div>
<p>Many of the operations done by Maxima among numbers can also
be done among lists. For example, to get another list in which
each element is the square root of the corresponding element
in the previous list, multiplied by 3, it is enough to
write:</p>

<p>A very useful function to create lists is
<span id="makelist" class="index maxf
                           notranslate">makelist</span>, which expands an expression,
replacing various different values for a given variable. The
first argument given to <span class="maxf
                                     notranslate">makelist</span> must be the expression to be
expanded and the second argument is the name of the variable
that will be replaced by a sequence of values from an initial
value and up to a maximum value defined by the third and
fourth arguments.  If a fifth argument is given, it will be
used as the increment in the sequence of values that will be
replaced; otherwise, the default increment of 1 will be
used. Two examples of the use of this function are the
following</p>

<p>In the first list, the cubes of 1, 2, 3, 4 e 5 were
computed. In the second one, the cubes of 2, 2.6, 3.2, 3.8,
4.4, 5.0 and 5.6 were computed.  Notice that the cubes of
floating-point numbers resulted in floating-point numbers,

</p>
<p>Both <span class="maxi notranslate">%pi</span> and
<span class="maxi notranslate">%e</span> are irrational
numbers which cannot be represented exactly with a finite
number of digits, but a floating-point approximation, with 16
significant digits, can be obtained using function
<span class="maxf notranslate">float</span>; a numerical
representation with more significant digits can also be found
using function
<span class="maxf notranslate">bfloat</span> and variable

<p>The imaginary number <span class="maxi

<h2>A.8. Command files</h2>
<p>To save all the commands that have been entered during a work
session in Xmaxima, there is an option
&quot;<i class="notranslate">Save Maxima Input to
File</i>&quot; in the
&quot;<i class="notranslate">File</i>&quot; menu. The file
created with that option can be loaded later on into Maxima,
making all the commands in the file to be executed as if they
had been entered sequentially, by using option
&quot;<i class="notranslate">Batch File</i>&quot; in the
&quot;<i class="notranslate">File</i>&quot; menu. Maxima's
functions
<span id="stringout" class="index maxf
                            notranslate">stringout</span> and <span id="batch"
                                                                    class="index maxf notranslate">batch</span> can also be used
to do the same tasks, without using Xmaxima menu
options.</p>
<p>The file created contains simple plain-text, which can be
edited with a text editor. The commands entered will appear
without the tags
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i1)</span>,
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i2)</span>, etc; therefore, care
must be taken with commands that refer to previous results
<span class="verb notranslate">%o1</span>,
<span class="verb notranslate">%o2</span>, etc, since the
sequence of numbers assigned to those outputs might be
different. Comments can be included into that file, starting
them with the symbols <span class="verb notranslate">/*</span>
and ending with <span class="verb notranslate">*/</span>,
which can come several lines below the start of the comment.
The commands entered directly into Maxima or written into that
file can also contain blank spaces between numbers, operators,
variables and other objects, in order to make them more
readable, and each command can also expand several lines.</p>
<p>An efficient way to work with Maxima consists on starting by
writing a text file, called a
&quot;<i class="notranslate">batch</i>&quot; file, with the
commands that are going to be used, which would then be loaded
with the &quot;<i class="notranslate">Batch File</i>&quot;
option. That way, if an error appears making it necessary to
reenter the same commands, it will be enough to correct the
wrong command in the file and to load it again. The commands
in that file should be written without any
tags <span class="maxm notranslate">(%i1)</span>,
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i2)</span>,&hellip; which will be
assigned automatically when the file is run.</p>
<p>Xmaxima's option &quot;<i class="notranslate">Save Console to
File</i>&quot;, in the &quot;<i class="notranslate">Edit</i>&quot;
menu, saves all the information shown in the screen, including
the tags <span class="maxm notranslate">(%i1)</span>,
<span class="verb notranslate">(%o1)</span>,
<span class="maxm notranslate">(%i2)</span>,
<span class="verb notranslate">(%o2)</span>, etc.
That file can be useful for documenting, but it cannot be reused as
<i class="notranslate">batch</i> file.</p>
<p>Some commands that are used repeatedly in different working
sessions, for instance, the definition a frequently used
function, can be placed inside a file that would then be
loaded using
<span class="maxf">batch</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxs">"file"</span><span class="maxd">)</span>,
where "file" is the complete name and path of the file used.
If the name of the file does not include a path to the
directory where it is located, it will be searched first in
the current directory and then in a directory where Maxima
expects to find user's batch files. The default location of
that directory can be seen examining the contents of the
system variable
<span id="maxima_userdir" class="index maxv notranslate">maxima_userdir</span>.</p>
<p>A <i class="notranslate">batch</i> file can also be loaded
automatically every time Maxima is started, if it is given the
name <span id="maxima-init.mac" class="index maxf
                                       notranslate">maxima-init.mac</span> and it is placed in the
directory where Maxima expects to find user's batch files. For
example, the Maxima sessions shown in the chapters of this
book are run in a system where there is a
file <span class="maxf notranslate">maxima-init.mac</span> in
the directory
&quot;<span class="notranslate">/home/username/.maxima</span>&quot;,
with the following contents:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxv">ratprint</span><span class="maxd">:</span><span class="maxm"> false$</span><br>
<span class="maxv">fpprintprec</span><span class="maxd">:</span><span class="maxn"> 4</span><span class="maxm">$</span>
</div>
<p>thus, each time Maxima is started, the system variable
<span class="maxv notranslate">ratprint</span> will get the
logical value false, which will turn off the warnings about
floating-point numbers being automatically replaced by
rational numbers and the system variable
<span class="maxv notranslate">fpprintprec</span> gets the
value 4, which makes floating-point numbers to be shown in the
screen with only 4 significant digits. Any other valid Maxima
commands can be placed into that file, but care must be taken
not to include commands that lead to errors, which could block
Maxima preventing it to start.</p>

<h2>A.9. Algebra</h2>
<p>Expressions can include mathematical operations with abstract
variables. For example:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i33)</span> <span class="maxn">3</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxv">x</span><span class="maxo">^</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxo"> +</span><span class="maxn"> 2</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxf">cos</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxv">t</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">$</span>
</div>
<p>Those expressions can then be manipulated producing new
expressions. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i34)</span> <span class="maxm">%</span><span class="maxo">^</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxo"> +</span><span class="maxv"> x</span><span class="maxo">^</span><span class="maxn">3</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

<p>There are two complex roots and a real one. The three roots
were placed inside a list. To extract, for instance, the
right-hand-side of the third root in the list, the
command <span class="maxf">rhs</span> (short for
<i class="notranslate">right-hand side</i>) is used:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i37)</span> <span class="maxf">rhs</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxm">%</span><span class="maxd">[</span><span class="maxn">3</span><span class="maxd">])</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

<p>Variable <span class="maxv">x</span> remains undefined, since
the equal sign does not link the variable to the value on the

expressions for the roots can be found using the command
<span id="solve" class="index maxf notranslate">solve</span>,
which can also solve other types of equations, not only
polynomials.  For example, the roots found above could also
have been obtained with the following commands:</p>

lines and it was not shown in the screen; only the
approximation of those roots as floating-point numbers was
shown in this case.</p>
<p>Remember that when a variable name has already been linked to
a value, it will be necessary to type a single quote before
the variable name, to be able to use it as an abstract
algebraic variable. One can also remove the value linked to
that variable using function

in this case was only one.  The previous system could have
also been solved with the command

<p>Function <span id="factor" class="index maxf
                                     notranslate">factor</span> is used to factor expressions. Other
functions used to simplify expressions are <span id="ratsimp"
                                                 class="index maxf notranslate">ratsimp</span>,
<span id="radcan" class="index maxf notranslate">radcan</span>
and <span id="xthru maxf notranslate">xthru</span>.  Among
various equivalent expressions, the concept of simplicity is a
relative one and it is more a matter of taste; thus, different
simplifying functions might give different expressions, even
though they should be equivalent.  It is convenient to try out
various simplifying functions in each case and then choose a
preferred form of an expression. Also, in some cases, as it
happens with <span class="maxf notranslate">ratsimp</span>,
the results might be different when the same function is
applied again.</p>
<p>Function <span class="maxf notranslate">subst</span>, which
has been used above to substitute numerical values, can also
be used to substitute other expressions. For example, to
substitute <svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' width='0.7402038em' height='0.6832239em' viewBox='-0.360891 -6.100747 7.402038 6.832239' class='inline' style='vertical-align:-0.0696em'>

<p>Algebraic expressions are represented internally as lists;
hence, some Maxima functions for lists can also be used with
expressions. For instance, function
<span id="length" class="index maxf notranslate">length</span>
gives the length of a list and it can also be used to compute
the number of terms in an expression; for instance</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i46)</span> <span class="maxf">length</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxv">res</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>
(%o46) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2
</div>
<p>Since the expression <span class="maxv
                                     notranslate">res</span> was combined into a common
denominator, the two terms accounted for by
<span class="maxf notranslate">length</span> are the
numerator and denominator of the expression; therefore,
function <span id="first" class="index maxf">first</span>, which
extracts the first element in a list, will show only the
numerator of the expression linked to <span class="maxv
                                                   notranslate">res</span></p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i47)</span> <span class="maxf">first</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxv">res</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

, is called an <b>atom</b>; functions that expect a list as
its argument will usually trigger an error when they are given
an atom as the argument.  Function <span id="atom"
                                         class="index maxf notranslate">atom</span> tells whether the
argument given is an atom or not.</p>
<p>Another function which is very useful to deal with lists is
<span id="map" class="index maxf notranslate">map</span>,
which will apply a given function to each element in a
list. In the case of a rational expression, it can be used to
apply a function to the numerator and denominator of the
expression. For example, notice the different results obtained
by expanding an expression and expanding its numerator and
denominator separately:</p>

<h2>A.10. Trigonometry</h2>
<p>Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-A.1">A.1</a> shows the names of the
main trigonometric functions in Maxima. The functions that
expect an angle as their input argument interpret that angle
in radians and not in degrees, since Maxima also knows some
properties of those functions, including their power series,
which are only valid when the angle is given in radians.  The
results given by the inverse functions are angles in
radians.</p>

<h2>A.12. Functions</h2>
<p>A Maxima function is a program with some input variables and
an output.  Maxima has a simple programming language that is
used to define those functions and it is also possible to use
Lisp, which is the language in which Maxima is written, to
define functions. It is even possible to redefine any of the
functions that have been referred; for instance, if in the
Maxima version being use some function has a bug that has
already been fixed in a more recent version, it is possible to
load the new version of the function and, unless it introduces
conflicts with other older functions, it should work
correctly.</p>
<p>A first example of a function is a
<span class="maxf notranslate">fact</span> to compute the
factorial of an integer number (to get the factorial of a
number in Maxima one just has to type an exclamation sign !
after it, but another version of the same program will be
defined here):</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use any command to return the output,
since the output of the last command in the function will
become the output of the function. A function can call itself
recursively as it has been done in this example.</p>
<p>Several Maxima commands can be grouped together by typing
them inside parenthesis and separated by commas. Those
commands are run sequentially and the result of the last
command will be the result of the whole group.  Each command
can be indented and can expand more than one line. The
following example defines a function that adds all the
arguments given to it:</p>

<p>A list was used as the argument for the function, which makes
the function accept any number of input variables (or none)
and all the input variables will be placed in a list linked to
the local variable
<span class="maxv notranslate">v</span>. Function
<span id="block" class="index maxf notranslate">block</span>
was used to define another local variable
<span class="maxv">s</span>, with an initial value of 0,
which by the end of the function will have the sum of the
input variables. The first element given to
<span class="maxf notranslate">block</span> must be a list,
with any number of local variables, each one with or without
an initial value and after that list follows the remaining
part of the function definition. The command
<span class="maxm notranslate">for</span> iterates the local
variable <span class="maxv notranslate">i</span> &mdash;in
this case from 1 up to the length of the list
<span class="maxv notranslate">v</span>&mdash; with
increments, by default, equal to 1 (option
<span class="maxm notranslate">step</span> can be given to
modify the default value of that increment). When the
iterations are done, the value of the variable is shown to
make it become the output of the function.</p>
<p>When an unknown function is used no errors are triggered;
instead, the unknown function is echoed in the output; for
example:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i77)</span> <span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxn">4</span><span class="maxo">*</span><span class="maxf">maximum</span><span class="maxd">(</span><span class="maxn">3</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn">5</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn">2</span><span class="maxd">)</span><span class="maxm">;</span><br>

<p>That behavior is very useful, because it makes it possible to
change the value of the arguments later on and to reevaluate
the function.  For example, substituting
variable <span class="maxv notranslate">x</span> by the
floating-point number 2.0 in this last result, the logarithm
would then be computed:</p>

<p>For instance, the following command saves the plot produced by
command

<div class="maxima notranslate">

<p>The result shows that two files were created; the first
one, named <kbd class="notranslate">maxout.gnuplot</kbd>
contains the Gnuplot commands that will generate the plot
and save the result into the second file name
shown, <kbd>function1.png</kbd>. Since no path was given for
the name of the file in the
<span class="maxk notranslate">png_file</span> option,
the file is created in the user directory. File
<kbd class="notranslate">maxout.gnuplot</kbd> contains plain
text which can be edited with a text editor and run,
independently of Maxima, using
program <kbd class="notranslate">gnuplot</kbd>:</p>

<h3>A.13.3. Points plots</h3>
<p>It is also possible to create plots with lists of points in
a two-coordinate system. The two coordinates of each point
can be given as a list, inside another list with all the
points. For example, to show the three points (1.1, 5),
(1.9, 7) and (3.2,9) in a plot, the points coordinates can
be placed inside a list linked to
<span class="maxv notranslate">p</span>:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i84)</span> <span class="maxv">p</span><span class="maxm">:</span><span class="maxd"> [[</span><span class="maxn">1.1</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 5</span><span class="maxd">], [</span><span class="maxn">1.9</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 7</span><span class="maxd">], [</span><span class="maxn">3.2</span><span class="maxd">,</span><span class="maxn"> 9</span><span class="maxd">]]</span><span class="maxm">$</span>
</div>
<p>To create the plot, it is necessary to give
<span class="maxf notranslate">plot2d</span> a list that
starts with the keyword
<span class="maxk notranslate">discrete</span>, followed by
the list of points. In this case it is not mandatory to
specify an interval of values for the variable in the
horizontal axis:</p>
<div class="maxima notranslate">
<span class="maxm">(%i85)</span> <span class="maxf">plot2d</span><span class="maxd"> ( [</span><span class="maxk">discrete</span><span class="maxd">, </span><span class="maxv">p</span><span class="maxd">] )</span><span class="maxm">;</span>
</div>
<p>The plot is shown in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-A.4">A.4</a>.</p>
<figure class="center" id="fig-A.4">

     style="width:25.74em">
<figcaption>
<b>Figure A.4:</b> Plot of a set of 3 points.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By default, the points are linked by line segments; to show
only the points, without line segments,
option <span class="maxk notranslate">style</span> should be
used with a value equal to the keyword <span class="maxk
                                                    notranslate">points</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec-A.13.4">
<h3>A.13.4. Points and functions</h3>
<p>Several sets of points and several functions can also be
shown in a single plot. In that case, each set of points
should be represented by a list that starts with the
keyword <span class="maxk notranslate">discrete</span>, as
in the previous section, and each function should be
represented by an expression (or function name). All the
lists of points and expressions should also be enclosed
within another list and it will be necessary to specify a
range of values for the independent variable (the one in the
horizontal axis); a range of values for the variable in the
vertical axis is not mandatory, but can be given using
option <span class="maxk">y</span>.</p>

object, which is the list of points in the table, to be
represented as isolated points and the second object, which
is the expression for the expected curve, to be represented
by small line segments, which is the default behavior. The
plot is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-A.5">A.5</a>. Option
<span class="maxk notranslate">y</span> was used in order to
leave some space above for the legend; that option is also
very useful in the case of functions with vertical
asymptotes, to limit the values on the vertical axis thus
preventing the vertical axis to extend up to very large
values.</p>
