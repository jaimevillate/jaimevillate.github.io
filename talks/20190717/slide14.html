<p>
I have also written a new Moodle module, <b>exam</b>, based on
the <b>quiz</b> standard module.
</p>
<ul class="spacious">
<li>
Creates Moodle quizzes that students cannot answer. Only view them
after they have been "answered" by the teachers.
</li>
<li>
When the XML version of the exam is imported into Moodle, the
questions are added to the standard questions database.
</li>
<li>
The XML exam is also imported into the exam module, leaving it ready
to be graded by the teachers.
</li>
<li>
The teacher selects the student to evaluate, from a list of participants,
copies the multiple-choice answers, and writes down a grade and
comments for the problems.
</li>
<li>
Once the answers are copied, the final grade is computed
automatically and the student can see the result, as if it had
been answered by him in Moodle.
</li>
</ul>
