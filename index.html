<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I have enjoyed teaching since I started helping my classmates and
neighbors when I was 13. In the Faculty of Engineering of the
University of Porto I have taught courses on physics and differential
equations. I also enjoy programming and have written programs to help
solve problems in physics, to publish my lecture notes making them
more accessible, and to generate exams and speed up their grading and
publication of the results.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I am currently interested in Quantum Computing, Computer Algebra
(CAS) and E-learning Systems.</p>
<p>My research career started in the area of Theoretical Particle
Physics, which was the subject of my Ph. D. When I accepted a teaching
position in the Department of Chemical Engineering at FEUP in 1992,
that research area was no longer germane to my teaching duties. I then
decided to start research in the area of Physical Properties of Food;
I proposed several senior projects for the B. S. Program in Chemical
Engineering and participated in a European Project and a CYTED
project.</p>
<p>In 1994 a new B. S. program in Computer Science was created at FEUP
and I expressed my interest in teaching the two semesters of Physics
proposed for that program, with the prospect of starting research in
Computational Physics. Around that time I first heard of the
new <em>World Wide Web</em> and I started creating Websites and
exploring their advantages for teaching. At the root of the success of
that new technology was information sharing using open standards. I
thus became keen on Free Software and started using it
exclusively.</p>
<p>I joined the ATLAS collaboration at the <em>Large Hadron
Collider</em> of CERN in 2001. That opened the possibility of engaging
some of my engineering students in areas that support particle physics
experiments: GRID clusters, databases for experiment management and
control, and information systems. Being such a large experiment, ATLAS
involves several thousand researchers; to have any significant
contribution in that project, one must participate in many meetings in
various locations. That task became incompatible with my teaching
duties, so I had to abandon that project.</p>
