The major project in which I am involved since 2006 is the development
of the software <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/"
target="_blank">Maxima</a>. It is a Free Software project without any
funding. I have developed new versions of
the <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_61.html"
target="_blank">plotting programs</a>, a module for
the <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_224.html"
target="_blank">graphical analysis of dynamical systems</a>, functions
to
<a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_112.html"
   target="_blank">solve systems of differential equations numerically</a>
and a <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_196.html"
   target="_blank">combinatorics</a> module. I also maintain the graphical
interface <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/xmaxima/xmaxima.html"
             target="_blank">Xmaxima</a> and the
<a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io" target="_blank">Website</a> of
the project.

My contribution to this project was as advisor to the Informatics
Center team that created a special edition of the Ubuntu operating
system tailored to the needs of the Faculty of Engineering. That
system has been used since to install the Linux system in all the
computers in student's rooms and lecture halls.

Informatics and Computing Engineering to make a Michelson
Interferometer, at the Physics Department, accessible via Web. The
Mechanical Engineering students undertook the structure to control the
interferometer remotely and the Web interface. The Informatics
students created a <a href="http://fisica.fe.up.pt/michelson/"
target="_blank">virtual version of the interferometer</a>, which can
be used to conduct virtual experiments on interferometry

<dt><b>MAFIQUI</b></dt>
<dd>
Funded by: Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto<br>
Period: 2004 &ndash; 2005<br>
Principal investigators: António Machado e Moura, Francisco Restivo<br>
A new course was introduced in the Engineering
School in 2004, called <b>FEUP Project</b>, to be attended by all
freshman students during their first month at the school. As part of
that course, students were required to take quizzes to assess their
knowledge in Math, Physics and Chemistry (MAFIQUI: <i>MAtemática,
FÍsica e QUÍmica</i>); the results of the first quiz was used to place
the students in different level courses that run for a few weeks,
followed by a second quiz. The aim was to prepare the students for
their programs. I was in charge of preparing the logistics of the
quizzes and coordinate the work of the Professors writing the quiz
questions and the work of the teaching assistants conducting the
recitation sessions. In the first year (September of 2004), there were
170 students enrolled and in the second year (September of 2005) all
850 freshman students were enrolled. The course was suspended after
that second year. I developed a system to prepare written multiple
choice quizzes, whose answers were then transferred to the Moodle
server by the teaching assistants, allowing students to see their
graded quizzes on-line. I have been using that same system in the
courses I teach since then.

<dt><b>Moodle@FEUP</b></dt>
<dd>
Funded by: Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto<br>
Period: 2004 &ndash; 2005<br>
Principal investigator: Jaime Villate<br>
I started using Moodle in 2002. At that time, the e-learning system
used in the School was Luvit; it had the problem of not being
translated into Portuguese and, being proprietary software, we could
not undertake its translation. I wrote the first Portuguese
translation for Moodle and started using it in my courses since
2003. In 2003 some colleagues asked me to give them access to my
Moodle server and in 2004 the School's Board of Directors decided to
replace Luvit by Moodle and provided me with funding to hire a
graduate student to help with that migration.

<dt><dt><b><a href="https://paginas.fe.up.pt/freefeup/index.html" target="_blank">Free Software at FEUP</a></b></dt>
<dd>
Funded by: Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto<br>
Period: 2004<br>
Principal investigator: José Magalhães Cruz<br>
The aim of this project was to help the School administration and
academic staff to migrate from proprietary software to free
software and to stimulate the use of Free Software by students and professors.
We were three professors in charge of the project, helped by
three undergraduate students who recruited.
