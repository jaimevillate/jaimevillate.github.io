My main current research interests are small satellites for Earth
observation, Computer Algebra (CAS) and E-learning Systems.
</p>
<p>
My research career started in the area of Theoretical Particle
Physics, which was the subject of my Ph. D. When I accepted a teaching
position in the Department of Chemical Engineering at FEUP in 1992,
that research area was no longer germane to my teaching duties. I then
decided to start research in the area of Physical Properties of Food;
I proposed several senior projects for the B. S. Program in Chemical
Engineering and participated in a European Project and a CYTED
project.
</p>
<p>
In 1994 a new B. S. program in Computer Science was created at FEUP
and I expressed my interest in teaching the two semesters of Physics
proposed for that program, with the prospect of starting research in
Computational Physics. Around that time I first heard of the
new <em>World Wide Web</em> and I started creating Websites and
exploring their advantages for teaching. At the root of the success of
that new technology was information sharing using open standards. I
thus became keen on Free Software and started using it exclusively.
</p>
<p>
I joined the ATLAS collaboration at the <em>Large Hadron Collider</em>
of CERN in 2001. That opened the possibility of engaging some of my
engineering students in areas that support particle physics
experiments: GRID clusters, databases for experiment management and
control, and information systems. Being such a large experiment, ATLAS
involves several thousand researchers; to have any significant
contribution in that project, one must participate in many meetings in
various locations. That task became incompatible with my teaching
duties, so I had to abandon that project.
