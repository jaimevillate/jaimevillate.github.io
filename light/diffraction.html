<h2>Diffraction of light</h2>

<p>Two experiments used by Fresnel as strong arguments in favor of the
wave theory of light (by the end of the XVIII century and beginning of
the XIX century) were the <strong>interference</strong> when light
goes through two slits and the <strong>diffraction</strong> of
light.</p>
<p>When two waves emitted from two point sources are combined they
produce an <strong>interference pattern</strong>: there are localized
regions where the resulting wave has maximum and minimum values. In
the case of light, those interference patterns are observed as bright
and dark regions.</p>
<p>Diffraction is the tendency of waves to &quot;go around&quot;
obstacles. At the boundary between light and shadow projected by an
object one can observe interference patterns which are the result of
the diffraction of light.</p>
<p>Those two phenomena, interference and diffraction, are a signature
of the oscillatory nature of waves and would not occur in the case of
beams of particles. Therefore, interference and diffraction of light
are proofs of its wave nature.</p>
