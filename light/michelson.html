<h2>Michelson interferometer</h2>

<p>By the end of the XIX century Maxwell's contributions to the theory
of electromagnetism established the wave nature of light as an
<strong>electromagnetic wave</strong>. Namely, a combination of time-varying
electric and magnetic fields that can prevail even in the absence of
any charges or electric currents.</p>
<p>One of the biggest successes of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory
was that it could correctly predict the speed of light, from the
values of the electric and magnetic constant, in very good agreement
with the value measured experimentally for the speed of light.</p>
<p>But since the values of the electric and magnetic fields are
different when measured in a moving reference frame, the speed of
light could not be the same in all reference frames. It also seems
evident that if we move with respect to the medium where a wave is
propagating, we will measure a different speed for that wave; thus the
speed at which a wave propagates is different in different frames.</p>
<p>Most XIX century physicists believed there was an absolute space
(the hypothetical ether) where Maxwell's equations would be valid. The
speed of light derived from those equations would be the speed of
light with respect to that absolute space. Measuring the speed of
light in deifferent reference frames would then allow us to determine
the <strong>absolute speed</strong> of those frames.</p>
<p>Many experiments were conducted using light from the stars and
light from sources on Earth. All of those experiments always failed in
detecting any differences in the speed of light; it seemed impossible
to detect any differences when the source and/or the observer were in
motion. After each new failed experiment a new amendment would be
introduced into the theory of ether to account for that failure, such
as the principle of ether dragging by sources or observers. Ether
dragging didn't seem to follow any simple rules but it rather appear
as an artifice that could adjust any possible result.</p>
<p>An active research activity in that area led Michelson to conceive
several experimental devices to detect minute differences in the speed
of light in a moving reference frame. The evolution of those devices
culminated in an interferometer known as Michelson interferometer,
where any effect of ether dragging could clearly be eliminated.</p>
<p>A Michelson interferometer splits a light ray into two
perpendicular beams s the ray passes through a semitransparent mirror
that reflects half of the light and lets the other half pass
through. The two beams, emitted from the same source, are then
reflected back to the beam splitter, where they interfere with each
other creating an interference pattern that is projected into a
screen.</p>
<p>The distance travel by the tow beams (optical paths) can be
adjusted with high precision. A slight variation on the time taken by
the two beams to travel those paths can be observed as a shift of the
firnges in the interference pattern. If the speed of light were
different in different directions (due to the motion of the Earth), as
the interferometer were rotate the interference pattern should
move.</p>
<p>Michelson and Morley conducted that experiment failing to observe
any effect of the motion of Earth on the speed of light. What they
observed was that the speed of light was the same in all
directions. Lorentz explained that result assuming a contraction of
the ether in the direction of the motion of the Earth. But it was not
possible to find a cause and a mechanism for that contraction.</p>
<p>In 1905 Einstein publishes his <strong>theory of
relativity</strong>, according to which the speed of light should be
the same in any reference frame. One of the consequences of that
postulate is that time and distance are no longer absolute quantities,
as our common sense tells us, but can take different values for
different observers. There is no absolute space or ether.</p>
<p>Accepting only two simple principles: the laws of physics are the
same for any observer and the speed of light is constant, Einstein
derives the same equations obtained by Lorentz. But the contraction of
distance and dilation of time are real relativistic effects, with many
consequences that have already been observed in experiments, rather
than just a contraction of the ether as believed by Lorentz.</p>
