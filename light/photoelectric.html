<h2>The photoelectric effect</h2>

<p>Maxwell's theory of light, in which light is just an
electromagnetic wave, opened up the possibility of producing other
types of electromagnetic waves using electric circuits. The first
person to succeed in that effort was Hertz, by the end of the XIX
century. Ironically, while conducting the experiment that proved the
existence of electromagnetic waves, leading to the end of the
corpuscular theory of light, he accidentally discovered the effect
that would later be used to revive that theory: while conducting his
electromagnetic wave experiments, he noticed that light from a spark
in a circuit could induce an electric current in another remote
circuit used to detect the electromagnetic waves produced by the
first.</p>
<p>A few years later when the electron was discovered by Thomson, it
became clear that the effect observed by Hertz, dubbed as
<strong>photoelectric effect</strong>, was due to some electrons being
ejected from a metal when a light ray reaches its surface.  The
electromagnetic energy transported by light is absorbed by the
electrons in the metal, allowing them to get free from the binding in
the metal. The problem that nobody was able to explain by the
beginning of the XX century was why the energy of the electrons
ejected by photoelectric effect does not increase when the intensity
of the incident light increases, but it does increase as the frequency
of that light increases. In fact, for each metal there is a minimum
frequency of light under which there is no photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>The energy of the electrons ejected by photoelectric effect can be
measured if we connect an external voltage source to the photoelectric
cell and adjust the source's voltage (opposed to the cell's
voltage) until the current in the circuit vanishes.</p>
<p>In 1905, when there was no doubt about the wave theory of light,
Einstein published a paper where he perfectly explained the
photoelectric effect by assuming that light is composed of particles
&mdash;<strong>photons</strong>&mdash; with energy directly
proportional to the frequency of the light.  In the theory of photons,
the energy transported by light cannot be increased continuously but
rather in discrete amounts, corresponding to 1 photon, 2 photons, 3
photons and so on. That theory also explained the success of Planck's
hypothesis (1900) to explain the black-body radiation spectrum, under
the assumption that the energy radiated by a black body could only
take discrete values &mdash;<strong>quanta</strong>&mdash; of
energy.</p>
<p>The work of Planck and Einstein would give rise to <strong>quantum
  physics</strong>, in which all physical objects are entities which are
both particles and waves (wave-particle duality).  Energy is
transported from one place to another as waves, but that energy is
emitted and absorbed in discrete amounts, as particles.  Light, as
well as any type of matter, is both a wave and a particle. That's the
reality at the sub-microscopic level, but at the macroscopic level of
our daily experience there seems to be a clear distinction among waves
and particles.</p>
