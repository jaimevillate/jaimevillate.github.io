<p>This exhibition, within the commemorations of the International
Year of Physics, was shown at the Library of the Faculty of
Engineering of the University of Porto, from April 21 to June 13
2005.</p>

<p>Light is a phenomenon that has attracted the attention of many
scientists throughout history. The physical explanation of light gave
rise to two main rival theories, source of very heated debates among
the scientific community. Those two rival theories were only
reconciled in 1905 after Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric
effect, which is one of the events commemorated during <strong>2005 &mdash;
International year of Physics</strong>.</p>
<p>The experiments in this exhibition follow the evolution of the
theories of light from Newton (XVII century) to Einstein (XX
century). There is a separate Web page for each experiment (see list
below) and the whole brochure can also be downloaded as
a <a href="../publications/Villate_2005_Theories_of_Light.pdf"
target="_blank">PDF file</a>.</p>
