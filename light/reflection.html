<h2>Light reflection and refraction</h2>

<p>When we place a barrier with a slit in front of a light source, only
the light rays in the lines that go through the source and the slit
can go through the barrier. That way we can produce a thin light
beam.</p>
<p>That fact is an argument in favor of the <strong>corpuscular theory
  of light</strong>, which asserts that light is composed of small
particles ejected in straight lines from the source.
</p>
<p>Light is reflected in a plane mirror with the incident and
reflected rays making the same angle with the surface of the
mirror. That's what we would expect from a system of small particles
hitting a rigid surface.</p>
<p>Light <strong>refraction</strong> is the passage of a ray of light
from one medium to a different one. In that case, the angles of the
incident ray and the refracted one with the surface dividing the two
media are not the same.  The relation between those two angles depends
on the two media. The corpuscular theory of light explains that
difference by assuming that the speed of light is different in the two
media.</p>
<p>The <strong>wave theory</strong> of light can also explain how
beams of light are formed as well and the equality of the incidence
and reflection angle and the difference between the angles of the
incident and refracted rays.  However, its arguments for those
phenomena are not as straight forward as in the corpuscular
theory.</p>
<p>In the case of refraction there is an important difference between
the predictions of the two theories. When light passes from air to
water, the refracted ray comes closer to the perpendicular to the
boundary surface. According to the corpuscular theory that
approximation is due to a higher speed of light in water as compared
to air. In the wave theory it is concluded that the speed of light is
lower in water then in air.</p>
<p>In Newton's and Huygen's time (XVII century) the speed of light
could not be measured with enough accuracy to determine which theory
was right, so the stronger reputation of Newton prevailed and the
corpuscular theory was preferred over the wave theory. Nowadays we
know that light moves slower in water than in air as predicted by the
wave theory.</p>
