<p>The polarization of light is another prove of its wave nature. Some
crystals have the property of <strong>polarizing</strong> light: only
a part of the light, oscillating in a given plane, can pass through
them. Light coming out of a polarizing filter oscillates in a single
plane.</p>
<p>If we place a second polarizing filter after the first one and if
the polarization planes of the two filters are perpendicular, no light
will come out of the two filters. Light is also polarized when
reflected on a surface. If we look at the light reflected on a surface
through a polarizing filter, rotating the filter will make the
reflection disappear when the polarization plane of the filter is
perpendicular to the plane of the surface.</p>
<p>Liquid crystal have the property of polarizing light when there is
an electric current through them. That property is used to construct
the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) in a calculator or cellular
phone.</p>
<p>The polarization of light can be easily explained assuming that
light is a <strong>transversal wave</strong> (namely, it oscillates in
a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation). But at the
time of Newton and Huygens that argument was in fact used against the
wave theory of light. According to Huygens light waves would be
oscillations of a hypothetical medium called <strong>ether</strong> in
the same way that sound waves are oscillations of the air. But waves
propagating in an elastic medium, such as sound, must always be
<strong>longitudinal waves</strong> (the medium particles oscillate in the
same direction as the wave propagates). Thus, Newton concluded,
Huygen's wave theory of light cannot be valid.</p>
