<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net">Maxima</a> is a
free version of Macsyma (Project MAC SYMbolic MAthematics
program), one of the oldest Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), created by
<a target="_blank"
   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory">project
MAC</a> (MIT's Project on Mathematics and Computation) in the
late 1960s. It was originally coded for a PDP computer. Around
1982 a version dubbed as Vaxima started to be distributed for
the VAX computers. Professor William Schelter, a mathematics
professor at the University of Texas, Austin, continued to
develop that version and in 1998 was granted permission form
the Department of Energy, who own the rights to Macsyma, to
distribute it as Free Software, under the name of Maxima.
</p>
<p>
After the death of professor Schelter in 2001, a group of
volunteers was formed to continue the development and
distribution of Maxima. I joined that development team in
2006.
