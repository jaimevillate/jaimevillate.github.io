<h2>Interference of light beams</h2>
<p>On the screen (green) there are bright points (red) where there is
constructive interference. In between two bright zones there is a dark
zone with destructive interference.</p>

<p>Since each beam is a cone, the red fringes on the screen are
actually concentric circles, as shown on the following image, taken
from a real interferometer.</p>

<p>The radii of the circles will depend on the wave length and on the
distance to the screen. The position of the first circle depends on
the ratio between the distance and the wavelength.</p>
<p>If the distance between the sources was a integer multiple of the
wavelength, the brightest point would be at the center of the
interference pattern. If that distance was a half-integer times the
wavelength, the center of the pattern would be completely dark.</p>
<p>If the two sources were moving apart from each other, it will
appear as if there were circles coming out of the center of the
interference pattern. Each circle that goes out would correspond to a
displacement of a wavelength.</p>
