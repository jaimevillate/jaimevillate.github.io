I have been using only Free Software since 1994. My contributions to
Free Software users groups and projects are described in the

<h3>Projects at the Engineering School</h3>

<dt><b>Free Software at FEUP</b></dt>
<dd>
2004. This was a project approved by the dean of the Engineering
School, in order to help the School administration and academic staff
to migrate from proprietary software to free software. We were three
professors in charge of the project, helped by three undergraduate
students who recruited.

<dt><b>Moodle@FEUP</b></dt>
<dd>
I started using Moodle in 2002. At that time, the e-learning system
used in the School was Luvit; it had the problem of not being
translated into Portuguese and, being proprietary software, we could
not undertake its translation. I wrote the first Portuguese
translation for Moodle ans started using it in my courses since
2003. In 2003 some colleagues asked me to give them access to my
Moodle server and in 2004 the School's Board of Directors decided to
replace Luvit by Moodle and provided me with funding to hire a
graduate student to help with that migration.

<dt><b>Ubuntu Edição FEUP</b></dt>
<dd>
2006 &ndash; 2007. This project was aimed at creating a customized
version of the Ubuntu operating system adapted to our School. That
software distribution continues to be upgraded every year by the staff
of the Computer Center (CICA) and is installed in all the computers
used in student's computer rooms and lecture halls.
