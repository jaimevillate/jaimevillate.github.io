<section>
<p>This is a historic account of my experience with Free
Software. For a list of software that I have written,
follow <a href="software/index.html">this link</a>.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Free Software was around 1986 when was a
graduate student; I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"
target="_blank">LaTeX</a> to write reports and my <a target="_blank"
href="publications/Villate_1990_Thesis.pdf">Ph. D. thesis</a>. At
that time we used in our university VAX computers and we worked in
alphanumeric terminals (VT100). To make the diagrams and plots for my
thesis, I discovered the programming language
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript"
target="_blank">PostScript</a>; I would create a PostScript file using
a text editor and send it to a PostScript printer on campus. After
picking up my printout at the computer center, I could finally see the
result and go back to the terminal to modify the text file. It was
very frequent to spend hours to do a simple image, because my file
would have syntax or semantic errors.  To speed up the process, I
decided to write down several Postcript subroutines that I would then
reuse just changing the input parameters; that way I managed to reduce
the occurrence of errors.</p>
<p>When I started working as a postdoc in Portugal, in 1990, in
addition to the VAX computers our group also had PC computers running
Windows. A colleague of mine, Helmut Wolters, introduced me to several
Free Software programs that we could download and use instead of the
standard ones that came with Windows. The two that made a bigger
impact on me were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs"
target="_blank">Emacs</a> text editor
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript"
target="_blank">Ghostscript</a>, which allowed me to display my
PostScript files on the screen or even print them in my own dot-matrix
printer.</p>
<p>In 1994, when I was already teaching at the University of Porto, I
made my first installation
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"
target="_blank">Linux</a>; I started with
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware"
target="_blank">Slackware</a> distribution but later switched
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian"
target="_blank">Debian</a> that was maintained a community of
volunteer developers. With Linux I could use all the Free Software
programs I already knew and I didn't have to use Windows anymore.</p>
<h3>Reino Linux</h3>
<p>In 1998 we formed a Linux Users Group at the Faculty of Engineering
(FEUP).  Among its members, Raul Oliveira had already set up a local
network of PC's running Linux which he used for teaching computer
networks to his students; he called that room <em>Reino Linux</em>
(Linux Kingdom). We adopted that name for our group. Our first
important activity was a Linux Installation Party in which we invited
students and teachers to bring a computer and one of us wood install
Linux in it, while explaining the process and giving them a short
tutorial about Linux. We even offered free CD's with Linux
distributions. It was a big success and we had some other sessions
later.  We also used to have picnics to meet other Linux
enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Porto Cidade Linux, Cidade Tecnológica</h3>
<p>In 2000 Raul Oliveira got the support of the mayor of Porto, Nuno
Cardoso, to turn our Linux Installation Parties into a city event. The
mayor had a tent set up in front of the city hall where we held the
event, dubbed as <em>Porto Cidade Linux, Cidade Tecnológica</em>
(Porto, Linux city, technological city), on the 14th of July. We had a
special guest from Spain, Jesús González Barahona.</p>
<p>The big success of our big installation party led the mayor to turn it
into a yearly event which would promote the use of Free Software. The
2001 edition had a more formal organizing committee including members
of the city hall and Raul Oliveira and I as representatives of FEUP;
since it was no longer a Linux Installation party but rather a Free
Software event, it was named <a target="_blank"
href="pdf/Cidade_Tecnologica_2001.pdf"><em>Porto Cidade
Tecnológica</em></a>. It was held on October 12th in a landmark
building of the city, <em>Mercado Ferreira Borges</em>. We invited
Portuguese political figures, the Free Software Foundation which was
represented by its vice-president Bradley Khun and the French Free
Software Association, APRIL, represented by Loïc Dachary.</p>

<br class="clear">
<p>In 2002 the event (<a href="pdf/Cidade_Tecnologica_2002.pdf"
target="_blank"><em>Cidade Tecnológica 2002</em></a>) went on non-stop
for two days, between November 29 and 30, with booths for exhibitors
and space for computer demonstrations in one of the biggest sports
facilities in the city (Rosa Mota pavilion) and lectures in the
Almeida Garrett public library. A <a target="_blank"
href="pdf/Protocolo_2002.pdf">protocol</a> was signed among Porto's
City Hall, FEUP and ANSOL for its organization. In 2003 there was a
change of city mayor and the event was never held again.</p>
<h3>Associação Nacional para o Software Livre</h3>
<a target="_blank" href="https://ansol.org/"><img src="img/ansol.svg"
class="img-6 left" alt="Maxima logo" width="286" height="52"></a>
<p>In 1999 I got in touch with a Spanish group of Linux users,
Hispalinux.  They used to organized a congress every year with
hundreds of participants and very interesting presentations. In those
meetings I met some Spanish Debian developpers and I became a Debian
developer. Through the Debian's support mailing list I got in touch
with a group of Portuguese interested in Freee Software. With some of
them we attended the World Meeting on Free Software held every year in
Burdeaux, France, and we got in touch with the French association for
Free Software, APRIL.</p>
<p>By 2001 that group of Portuguese users decided to create a Portuguese
association for Free Software, following the examples of APRIL and
the Free Software Foundation. We named it
<a target="_blank" href="https://ansol.org/">ANSOL</a> (Associação
Nacional para o Software Livre). The announcement of the new
association was made during the event <em>Porto Cidade Tecnológica
2001</em>. Following that event we held the first meeting of the
association in my house with the following members: João Neves, Rui
Miguel Seabra, Rúben Mendes, Rui Leite and Hugo Nogueira, as well as
the two international guests of <em>Porto Cidade Tecnológica</em>,
Bradley Kuhn (Free Software Foundation) and Loïc Dachary (APRIL). I
was the first president of ANSOL between 2002 and 2004.</p>
<h3>Web design</h3>
<p>In 1994, when I heard about the World Wide Web at CERN, I started
creating my own Web pages. In the beginning of 1997 created a Website
for the Department of Chemical Engineering where I worked. The early
versions of that site can still be accessed through
the <a target="_blank"
href="http://arquivo.pt/wayback/19970718191312/http://www.fe.up.pt/deqwww/index.html">Historical
Web Archive</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote some CGI scripts that allowed the teachers to create and
update their web pages, using a system similar to what is nowadays
know as a <i>Wiki</i>. In 2001 I transferred from the Chemical
Engineering Department to the newly created Physics Engineering
Department. Between 2001 and 2010 I improved that wiki system to
maintain a Website for that new department.</p>
<h3>Moodle</h3>
<p>In 2002 I wrote an article arguing why the software we use to
deliver courses on the Web should be Free Software
(<a href="publications/index.html#villate-2002b">Villate</a>, 2002b)
and made a survey of several available free-software learning
management systems.  Among those systems I
chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moodle"
target="_blank">Moodle</a> and made its first translation into
Portuguese. During several years I remained in charge of updating that
translation as well as managing the section for Portuguese users in
Moodle's website.</p>
<p>In 2005 the University of Porto established a prize that would be
awarded every year to the teacher who showed the best use of
e-learning systems in a course. The contestants presented their
applications for the prize during a workshop open to the public; I was
the only applicant using a Free Software e-learning system
(<a href="publications/index.html#villate-2005f">Villate</a>, 2005f)
and was awarded the prize, <em>ex-aequo</em> with a course from the
Faculty of Nutrition and Food Sciences
(<a href="pdf/Moodle-JUP_2006.pdf" target="_blank">Porto University
Journal &mdash; JUP</a>, 2006).</p>
<p>I have participated in several projects related to Moodle and
supervised a Masters dissertation
(<a href="students.html#dutra-2006">Dutra</a>, 2006) and a
Ph. D. dissertation (<a href="students.html#marques-2015">Marques</a>,
2015) on the subject.</p>
<h3>Maxima</h3>
<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.io"
target="_blank"><img src="img/maxima.svg" class="img-3 left"
alt="Maxima logo" width="135" height="135"></a>
<p><a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.io" target="_blank">Maxima</a> is a
free version of Macsyma (Project MAC SYMbolic MAthematics
program), one of the oldest Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), created by
<a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory">project
MAC</a> (MIT's Project on Mathematics and Computation) in the late
1960s. It was originally coded for a PDP computer. Around 1982 a
version dubbed as Vaxima started to be distributed for the VAX
computers. William Schelter, a mathematics professor at the University
of Texas, Austin, continued to develop that version while the original
Macsyma version became property of the Department of Energy (DOE). In
1998 Schelter was formally granted permission from the DOE to
distribute his version as Free Software, under the name Maxima.</p>
<p>After the death of professor Schelter in 2001, a group of
volunteers was formed to continue the development and distribution of
Maxima. I joined that development team in 2006.</p>
<p>I have developed new versions of
the <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_68.html"
target="_blank">plotting programs</a>, a module for
the <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_258.html"
target="_blank">graphical analysis of dynamical systems</a>, functions
to
<a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_118.html"
target="_blank">solve systems of differential equations
numerically</a>,
a <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_204.html"
target="_blank">combinatorics</a> module and a package to
simulate <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_348.html"
            target="_blank">quantum computing circuits</a>. I have also
made many improvements to the graphical
interface <a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/xmaxima/xmaxima.html"
target="_blank">Xmaxima</a> and the
<a href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io" target="_blank">Website</a> of
the project.</p>
